# Code-Quiz

## Description

A timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side. I made this site fully responsive through media queries. It is deployed on Github Pages at: https://grlucy.github.io/Code-Quiz/

This web browser application is intended for use as a coding quiz that enables bootcamp students to gauge their learning progress. Scores are stored in local storage so that users can measure their performance against peers as well as measure how their own performance improves over time.

Technologies used:

> HTML, Git, CSS, and Javascript

## Usage

Users are asked to follow these instructions (which are displayed on the landing page in full-screen mode or through a link in mobile mode): "First, select a difficulty mode. The questions are the same, but you will have less time to answer them in hard mode. Once you have selected a difficulty mode, click the "Start Quiz" button. The timer will immediately start counting down. If it reaches 0, the quiz will end. Questions will appear one at a time. Click on your answer. You will be informed whether your answer was correct or incorrect when the next question appears. For each incorrect answer, there is a 10-second time penalty."

Score is calculated by the seconds remaining on the timer upon quiz completion. Stored high scores are displayed on both the high scores tab (full-screen) and the high scores page (mobile).
